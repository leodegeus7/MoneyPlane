# coreData
With this app was created a mechanism to send money to others with gestures.

This app was my first app using CoreData library. The main goal is facilitate the money exchange between users. 

To send money to other is just necessary type the quantitiy and shake the devices.
With the multipeer connectivity framework, the iphone will find the other and make the transaction.

Just shaking, easy and simple.
